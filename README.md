# WildFires

# Field Description:

A wildfire is an uncontrolled burn of vegetation, which includes the burning of forests, shrublands and grasslands, savannas, and croplands.

Wildfires can be caused by human activity — such as arson, unattended fires, or the loss of control of planned burns — and natural causes, such as lightning.

The spread of wildfires, once ignited, is determined by a range of factors, such as the amount and types of dry vegetation in the surrounding area, wind direction and speed, moisture levels, and heat. The amount of area burned by wildfires — and the impacts on ecosystems — is driven by a combination of weather patterns, human activity, the management of vegetation and landscapes, and responses to suppress their spread.

# Data Description:

There are 5 csv files in this dataset.

**cumulative_burnt_weekly:**
A useful way of tracking the evolution of wildfires across the year is to look at their week-by-week progression. This allows us to compare the extent of wildfires at a given time this year to the same period in a previous year.

It lets us see whether wildfires have started earlier or later than in previous years and whether they’re tracking above or below what we might expect from historical records.

**annual_burnt:**
How much area is burned by wildfires each year? The data for the current year is also included to allow you to put this year’s current burn figures into context.

**share_land_burnt:**
It’s useful to put the total extent of wildfires in the context of total land area: what share of land is burned each year?

Africa tends to be the region with the largest share of area burned — typically ranging from 6% to 8% each year. Figures tend to be lower in other regions but can vary a lot from year to year.

It’s important to note that the same land area can burn multiple times over successive years. So, a rate of 5% burn per year doesn’t mean that 50% of a country is burned over a decade. Some areas will burn multiple times over that period, while others will never be exposed.

**annual_burnt_per_wildfire:**
The spread of a wildfire, once ignited, will be influenced by many factors. Natural phenomena such as the type of vegetation, weather conditions, and the intensity of heat will influence how well the fire will be contained. Certain types of vegetation, for example, burn more easily than others. The effectiveness of the local fire containment management strategies will also play a role. This means some wildfires end up being significantly larger than others, and the impact can vary across different regions and countries.

**annual_burned_area_landcover:**
When “wildfires” are mentioned, people often picture forest fires. But lots of other ecosystem types can burn. Much larger areas of grasslands and savannas are burned each year than forests.
